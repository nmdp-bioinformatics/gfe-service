# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

Your imgt_db and biosqldb should be in running state
~to run both databases on docker use these links

#https://hub.docker.com/r/nmdpbioinformatics/imgt_biosqldb/
#https://hub.docker.com/r/nmdpbioinformatics/gfe-db/

Clone py-gfe locally with this command in the same directory as gfe-service
#https://github.com/nmdp-bioinformatics/py-gfe.git

To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory of gfe-service:

~Create a virtual environment usin python 3(to avoid dependencies issue use python3 lesser version then [3.7])
```
~virtualenv venv --python=python3
~ source venv/bin/activate
```
After activating the virtual environment run these commands

~pip3 install -r requirements.txt
~cd ../py-gfe/
~git checkout feature/helper-act-service
~pip install .
~cd ../gfe-service
~python main.py
```



and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger.json
```

~ Change Debug=False in production in `main.py`
